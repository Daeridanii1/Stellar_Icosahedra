# Stellar_Icosahedra
I decided to learn Unity, so I'm working on this. Right now all it does is generate low-poly deformed icosahedra that you can fly around, but I hope that it will grow into something more interesting.

If interested in looking at the prototypes, please see the release pages, as those are where the downloads are.
